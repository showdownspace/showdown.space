## About Code Golf Party

[**Code golf**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_golf) is a recreational programming activity where people find out what is the smallest possible source code to solve a certain problem.

**Code Golf Party,** organized by the [Creatorsgarten](https://creatorsgarten.org/) team, is an event where people meet up to play code golf, network with each other, and learn from each other.

In each round, participants receive a programming problem and write a program that solves it. After the round ends, the solutions are then ranked by the number of characters in the source code. Then we look and learn from the solutions.

We assume that many programming languages will be represented, so we hope that the participants can learn about programming languages that they may not use often, and find useful ideas in other programming languages that they can apply to their work.

## Application rounds

Due to the space constraints and safety concerns, only 60 people are allowed at the event.

With **over 200 applicants**, the application rounds are where the most intense code-golfing competition took place. (The actual event is more like a fun party than a serious competition.)

### Round 1

Applicants are asked to write a program that displays the following output using the shortest code possible [(see full problem description)](https://hackmd.io/@dtinth/Hyk_qaAp5):

```

################
```

Tickets are awarded to the top 10 applicants. Tickets are also awarded to 8 extra applicants who wrote the shortest code in each programming language (1 submission per language).

### Round 2A

Applicants are asked to write a program that lists all the 84 possible paths in the following directed acyclic graph using the shortest code possible [(see full problem description)](https://hackmd.io/@dtinth/HkoBY7eAq):

Tickets are awarded to the top 7 applicants.

### Round 2B

Applicants are asked to write a program that counts from 1 to 100 using the shortest code possible [(see full problem description)](https://hackmd.io/@dtinth/HkoBY7eAq).

Tickets are awarded to the top 5 applicants who wrote the shortest code in each programming language (1 submission per language).
