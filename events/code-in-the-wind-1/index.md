Efficiency is a key factor as there are many components, such as the story bar, the input boxes, the stickers, and the circular profile pictures, one of which must stick out of the sticker.

Some elements are placed arbitrarily on the page, so knowing how to use absolute positioning can also help.

</Challenge>

</Challenge>

### Finals: Control Room

<Challenge url='https://citw01.pages.dev/control-room-bb26bb872b3f/' rankingUrl='#final-round' submissionsUrl='https://citw01.pages.dev/submissions/#finals' referenceUrl='https://play.tailwindcss.com/M2ta4qfLFv?size=540x720'>

Inspired by the [control room scene from Squid Game](https://images.app.goo.gl/G3CijnEhS9rfykWB6), this challenge combines many areas of CSS knowledge.

CSS transforms are used to rotate the grid by 45 degrees. An extra rotation is added to keep the numbers and pictures inside the grid unrotated.

CSS filters and blend modes are used to apply filter to the cat images to give them a pink shade, as the provided cat images are full of color.
