## Format

In the event, challenges will be released one-by-one. They are simple web-based challenge that is impossible to complete manually by a human, so teams are expected to automate the browser to solve that challenge. (See below for example challenge.)

In each challenge, the teams that completed it faster will be awarded more points.

After a while (i.e. after we have the first finishers), we will reveal the solution to the challenge (the timing will depend on how quickly teams can solve the challenge), and release the next challenge. The challenge remains available to be solved until the end of the event.

At the event of the event, the points from all rounds are summed up to determine the final ranking, and awards and prizes are given accordingly.
